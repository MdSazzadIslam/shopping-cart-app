      "Easy to love. The Sven in birch ivory looks cozy and refined, like a sweater that a fancy lady wears on a coastal vacation. This ivory loveseat has a tufted bench seat, loose back pillows and bolsters, solid walnut legs, and is ready to make your apartment the adult oasis you dream of. Nestle it with plants, an ottoman, an accent chair, or 8 dogs. Your call.",

      "You know your dadâ€™s incredible vintage bomber jacket? The Nirvana dakota tan leather sofa is that jacket, but in couch form. With super-plush down-filled cushions, a corner-blocked wooden frame, and a leather patina that only gets better with age, the Nirvana will have you looking cool and feeling peaceful every time you take a seat. Looks pretty great with a sheepskinthrow, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-inlook, like your favorite leather jacket.",
